# Shipscope

Shipscope is a Chrome browser extension that monitors your projects on [Codeship](https://codeship.com). It provides the following features:

* Shipscope presents a popup containing all of your projects.
* The status of each project’s master branch is indicated next to the project name. 
* Clicking a project shows you the last 10 builds for that project.
* Each build’s status is displayed in the build list.
* If a build is running, you see a little spinny thing. That never gets boring.
* If a build has completed, you can restart it and get that spinny thing going again!

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shipscope/jdedmgopefelimgjceagffkeeiknclhh?hl=en). Please leave reviews and suggestions in the store.
